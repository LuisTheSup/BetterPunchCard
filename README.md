# BetterPunchCard

## Overview
A better version of a PunchCard system that me an my colleagues are developing at the FWCS Career Academy. The main reason of me creating this is to practice my skills and learn the Software Development Life Cycle; along with the challenges and technologies that come with developing a full-stack application, though simple I'm sure it will be fun.
